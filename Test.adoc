Multithreading:

Java Process: A process is an instance of a running program created by the OS.

In Java, the process is created by the Operating System when the ‘java’ command is executed.
The JVM runs inside that process, and only then the JVM creates multiple threads to execute your program.

Who creates the process in Java?
